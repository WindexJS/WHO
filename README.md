# WHO
WHO is a tool for the next generation of Javascript Developers. It is a tool that Obfuscates, protects and compiles javascript files to ensure that it is protected from the wide range of terrible things that could happen. It bundles anti-debug software into the program, before compiling it into an executable file!
